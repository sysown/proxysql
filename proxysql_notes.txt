Directories structure:
deps        : external dependencies, that can be redistributed thanks to their license
include     : header files
include_old : old header files , will be removed in future
lib         : directory where there is all the C++ code to generate libproxysql.a (archive file with all objects) and the various modules implemented as plugin compiled as shared libraries  
lib_old     : old code that was previously in lib , will be removed in future
oldcode     : old ProxySQL in C , will be removed in future
src         : here there are only 2 C++ files: main.cpp and proxysql_global.cpp (used for global variables)
test        : used for various testing, nothing interesting here , will be removed in future
trash       : like "test"



Dependencies :
ProxySQL relies on the following libraries that are compilied as dependancies:
- jemalloc (http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc/) : a general purpose malloc(3) implementation that emphasizes fragmentation avoidance and scalable concurrency support
- libconfig (http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/) : a simple library for processing structured configuration files
- libdaemon : a lightweight C library that eases the process of writing UNIX daemons
- mariadb-client-library : The MariaDB Native Client library (C driver) ; this is currently used only for headers
- memcached : high-performance, distributed memory object caching system ; it has important changes implemented: a) compiled as shared library and not daemon, b) pthread_key_t item_lock_type_key is configured as __thread variable instead of a static variables . Memcached integration into ProxySQL is currently a simple proof of concept
- re2 (https://code.google.com/p/re2/) : a fast, safe, thread-friendly alternative to backtracking regular expression engines like those used in PCRE, Perl, and Python . Important note:  re2 supports submatch extraction, but not backreferences . Because ProxySQL will process regular expression in an already thread-safe environment, re2 is patches to remove locking
- sqlite3 (http://www.sqlite.org/) : software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine 






Code in src:

proxysql_global.cpp :
This file only defines PROXYSQL_EXTERN , declaring all variables defined into proxysql_structs.h

main.cpp (not complete decription):
a) it defines all variables used to return objects defined as plugin
b) declare __thread l_sfp *__thr_sfp : this is used by a custom memory allocator that is **per_thread**
c) tune jemalloc : "xmalloc:true,lg_tcache_max:17"
d) defines number of threads (hardcoded for now), FIXME
e) defines the function mysql_worker_thread_func() that will later be called by each worker thread :
  1) initializes __thr_sfp used by a custom memory allocator
  2) points the worker function to what returned by create_MySQL_Thread() , that is returned by the shared library that provide this functionality
  3) listens on TCP and Unix socket
  4) waits all other threads watching the variable "load_"
  5) run the worker
  6) when the worker completes (because it received some shutdown command) it destroyes the worker and destroyes the customer memory allocator


f) create a new (and only!) MySQL_Hostgroups and add some servers in it : hardcoded for now
g) tried to open the config file : I think this is just a test, I need to check . FIXME
h) processes the command line options that have priority over the context of the config file , for example the path to the config file itself
i) processes the rest of the command line options and processes the config file
j) loads proxymemcached.so (hardcoded for now), calls memcached_main_thread(), and this calls __memcached_main() after configuring "command line options" . Temporary disabled
k) loads various plugin : Standard_Query_Cache.so , Standard_MySQL_Thread.so ,  Standard_Query_Processor.so , Standard_MySQL_Authentication.so , Standard_ProxySQL_Admin.so 
l) initializes GloAdmin calling create_ProxySQL_Admin()
m) initializes GloQPro calling create_Query_Processor() and creates the a rule hardcoded for now : FIXME
n) opens sockets on TCP and Unix
o) starts the mysql worker threads
p) starts the Query Cache (GloQC) and starts a new thread that calls GloQC->purgeHash_thread() , a maintenance thread that purge old entries
q) starts the MySQL Authentication module and adds some users, hardcoded for now : FIXME
r) waits for all mysql worker threads to be running watching the variable "load_"
s) loops waiting for glovars.shutdown==0 . Poor design, FIXME
t) set shutdown=1 on all mysql worker threads and wait for them to return
u) shutdown the Query Cache (GloQC) and waits the purge threads to return
v) delete Query Cache (GloQC), Query Processor (GloQP) , MySQL Authentication (GLOMyAuth) , Admin (GloAdmin), Hostgroups (MyHostGroups)

important files in "lib" :
advanced_kv.cpp : not used, FIXME , delete
configfile.cpp : implementation of class ProxySQL_ConfigFile to process config file
debug.cpp : implementation of the debug module . It uses a table in GloVars.global.gdbg_lvl where each row defines a debugging module and the verbosity associated with it .
	Currently it logs only to stderr, but future version will implement logging on an internal buffer and a background thread that will dump the buffer to disk. There is already some code ready for that.
gen_utils.cpp : implementation of classes PtrArray and PtrSizeArray (details below), and functions Proxy_file_exists() and Proxy_file_regular() (FIXME: these should be moved in FileUtils)
	PtrArray is a class with an array of pointers. It uses the custom per-thread memory allocator for the object itself: PtrArray created in a thread cannot be used into another thread. The array of pointers can either use the per-thread memory allocator (_use_l_alloc==true) , or the standard memory allocator .
	PtrSizeArray is a similar implementation of PtrArray, but each element of the array is a pointer and the size of the memory pointed by it. It uses *only* **per-thread** memory allocator.
