Introduction
============

ProxySQL is a high performance, high availability, protocol aware proxy for MySQL and forks (like Percona Server and MariaDB).  
All the while getting the unlimited freedom that comes with a GPL license.

Its development is driven by the lack of open source proxies that provide high performance.
